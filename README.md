# Bullet Game Project
A game project I have developed for making a game demo similar to [Bullet Inc by Rollic Games.](https://apps.apple.com/tr/app/bullet-inc/id6457264741) I hope this project can help me showcase my game development skills.
## Game Description
In this game players control a gun that shoots bullets to advance through the level. There are several objects that players could shoot. These objects include power up gates, move obstacles or objects that can change your gun's appearance. At the end of the level there are several Money Gates that can be shot for different money rewards. After a player finishes a level, their money transfers to the next level and level name increases by one.
## Game Objects
There are 3 type of gates that players can shoot to gain power ups: Bullet range gates, fire rate gates and double shoot gates. When a player pass through these gates, their powers will increase according to the number on the gates. When gates are on a positive number, their color is green. When gates are on a negative number, their color is red. There are woodden obstacles with numbers on them that can block a gate. If players can shoot these woodden obstacles to zero the gates will become accesable.
